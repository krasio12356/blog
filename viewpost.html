                        Cameras within Sophia's eyes combined with computer algorithms allow her to see. She can follow faces, sustain eye contact, and recognize individuals. She is able to process speech and have conversations using a natural language subsystem.[1] Around January 2018 Sophia was upgraded with functional legs and the ability to walk.[15]
                        Sophia is conceptually similar to the computer program ELIZA, which was one of the first attempts at simulating a human conversation.[16] The software has been programmed to give pre-written responses to specific questions or phrases, like a chatbot. These responses are used to create the illusion that the robot is able to understand conversation, including stock answers to questions like "Is the door open or shut?"[17] The information is shared in a cloud network which allows input and responses to be analysed with blockchain technology.[18]
                        David Hanson has said that Sophia would ultimately be a good fit to serve in healthcare, customer service, therapy and education.[19] Sophia runs on artificially intelligent software that is constantly being trained in the lab, so her conversations are likely to get faster, Sophia's expressions are likely to have fewer errors, and she should answer increasingly complex questions with more accuracy.
